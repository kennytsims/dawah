          How are we transforming the future of Islam in Botswana
        </h1>
        <p className="text-2xl mt-10 ">
          Since the first muslims set foot in Botswana around the 1960, No
          concerted effort has been made to to rigorious spread islam to native
          Batswana.As result the native muslim community is minuscule.It is
          estimated that Botswana whole muslim commnity in is about twenty
          thousand out of population of 2 million. Islam in Botswana is largesly
          dominated by people of indian decent who are the decendents of the
          muslim who come to Botswana in the 60's and the expariates
          community.The blacks muslims are generally foreigners,mostly
          expariates and few native Botswana. Due this fact Islam is perceived
          as an religion specific to indian. It remains largely misunderstood by
          the majority of Batswana. The islamic institutions such as mosques and
          associations such as Botswana muslim Association are managed
          ,run,dominated by people of indian decent at the experiance of The
          native Batswana muslim community. Botswana dawah unit is a reponse to
          no-representation of the native muslims and attend to the specific
          need of the communinity.

            Islam is the is fastest growing religion globally but in Botswana
            lacks behind. A deleberate structured dawah programs is critical to
            make an impact.

          <p className="m-5">
            One of the challenging problems for reverts or convets is that once
            they have become into the fold of islam resources to learn practice
            Islam are contrained. A helping and guiding hand"(tshipidi)" is
            critical in the new path. Having a community to absorb new muslims
            and giving support.

          <p className="m-3">
            Many people who convert to islam comme from a non-islamic background
            and families.they will continue to live and interact with non
            muslims on daily basis.It is therefore important to have islamic
            programs that is geared to create and understanding and coexistance
            with larger society. Many social acitivities such as marriages and
            funerals between a muslim and non-muslim family members pose a
            challenging an programs to proactively address issues before thay
            arise is one of the tools Dawah unit offers
